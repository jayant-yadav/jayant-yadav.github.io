Wednesday night, my friend texted me if I would like to visit Poland. By next Tuesday we were already on a plane to our first city Gdansk. This was a well needed trip as I had not travelled for leasure since I came to Sweden for my Masters. As I sat at the airport, we made a half-baked plan to do a city walk and visit a few museums. Lodging and inter-city travel was already sorted out on Friday night over a pizza. 

For the next 5 days and 4 nights, we visited and travelled: Gdansk -> Warsaw -> Krakow. Taking inter-city trains and staying at hostels except in Warsaw where we staying in Airbnb. Now this is a not a trip advisor so I am not going to reviewing my stays and sharing my itnerary much.

There are several other types of books which are not commonly found under this system. Albums are books for holding a group of items belonging to a particular theme, such as a set of photographs, card collections, and memorabilia. One common example is stamp albums, which are used by many hobbyists to protect and organize their collections of postage stamps. Such albums are often made using removable plastic pages held inside in a ringed binder or other similar holder. Picture books are books for children with pictures on every page and less text (or even no text).

> The longer I live, the more I realize that I am never wrong about anything, and that all the pains I have so humbly taken to verify my notions have only wasted my time!

Hymnals are books with collections of musical hymns that can typically be found in churches. Prayerbooks or missals are books that contain written prayers and are commonly carried by monks, nuns, and other devoted followers or clergy. Lap books are a learning tool created by students.

Some miscellaneous pictures that I feel deserved some publicity as it captures various characters in the city...
